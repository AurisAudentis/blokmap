# Blok Locaties Op Kaart Met Aanduidende Pins

A useful map that lists all the public study locations in Ghent.

Data is managed in a separate project, [Blokdata](https://github.com/ZeusWPI/Blokdata).

## Development

You can easily run the site locally by spawning a simple static file server in the `src` directory. For example by using the following command, or by using any other one-liner from [this big list](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).

```
(cd src/; python3 -m http.server)
```
